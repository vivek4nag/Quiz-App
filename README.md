## Code Structure

- **`index.html`**: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the quiz application.
- **`styles.css`**: The CSS file that styles the quiz application.
- **`script.js`**: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for displaying questions, handling user input, and calculating scores.

## Customization

You can customize the quiz by modifying the `questions` array in the `script.js` file. Each question object in the array has a `question` property for the question text and an `answers` property which is an array of answer objects. Each answer object should have:
- `text`: The text of the answer
- `correct`: A boolean indicating whether the answer is correct

Example:

```javascript
const questions = [
    {
        question: "Your new question?",
        answers: [
            { text: "Answer 1", correct: false },
            { text: "Answer 2", correct: true },
            { text: "Answer 3", correct: false },
            { text: "Answer 4", correct: false }
        ]
    },
    // Add more questions here
];
